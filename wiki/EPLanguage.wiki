===Structure===
Top level element in Event Plus is an interface. It defines one technical / business module. Not necessarily has to be the complete business solution. Remember multiple Context can interact with each other for parallel development to build the entire solution. Context provides a name space to the module.

  * @EPContext
{{{

@EPContext()
public interface StockQuoteAnalyzer {
}

}}}


Below is one advanced component taking advantage of processing already done in component above.
{{{

@EPContext(schemas={"StockQuoteAnalyzer"})
public interface AdvancedQuoteAnalyzer {
}

}}}

  * @EPContainer

{{{
@EPContext()
public interface StockQuoteAnalyzer {
        ................
        ................
        ................

        @EPContainer(generator = "generator.Portfolio")
        interface InputStocks {
                String symbol = null;
                Double quantity = null;
                Double tranPrice = null;
        }
        ................
        ................
        ................

}}}
